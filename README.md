# Misty-Skills
A collection of skills I've created/modified. 
# Attendance
An attendance tracker for SSA. To be used to make it simpler for Instructors to register attendance at the start of class.
# TV-Assassin
Misty the TV Assassin. With this skill and the hardware, misty can roam turning off TVs left and right. Although I used the TV-B-GONE kit from Adafruit, any TV-B-GONE will work.
# AdafruitIO-TTS
My quick solution to some TTS issues I was having, reads data from an adafruit feed and reads it.
# Gilfoyle-Alert
You know that one scene from Silicon Valley? Exactly. Plays an annoying audio <strike> when </strike> while dogecoin is efficient to mine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS1KcjkWdoU&ab_channel=lolValley
